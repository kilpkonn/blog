2022 was definitely more exciting year than usual from the investing perspective.
There had been a huge bull run in 2021 with S&P500 rising 26.89% and everything was screaming to fall looking back at it.
However the decline in 2022 still came as a surprise.
In addition to stocks losing in nominal value we are fighting inflation reaching 21.31% YoY in Estonia and 10.1% in Euroarea.

So without further ado, let's get started with the recap.

# Trades
Throughout the 2022 I tried to buy individual stocks that could withstand the inflation hopefully better than S$P500 as I was expecting it to fall.
Another motivation for it was that I wanted to have higher dividend yield than ~2%.
I also considered some other indexes, but usually they had either too high premiums or were banned in EU for regular in investors.
However I decided to buy some LuteCredit bonds in early summer to have also some more stable assets.

Picking individual stocks went south from the start as I managed do bet on Silvano Fashion Group in January and February.
When the Russian Federation launched it's full scale attack on Ukraine it got hit really hard and suffered over 50% drop in stock price.
Despite the bad news I didn't sell and managed to gain some back by the end of the year (still about 40% loss) and managed to also buy some other stocks that performed better.

I also decided to sell for the first time as Leo Vegas got merge offer with 50% premium over it's stock price.
All in all I invested in multiple individual stocks, mainly dividend stocks in Baltics but also in some more risky stocks such as BionTech.

Performance of each stock I had can be seen in the Figure below.

# Dividends and interests

For the 2022 I had a goal of getting 1000 eur passive income.
Well I failed that... but I managed to earn 800 which isn't that far off considering the fact that I bought quite many dividend stocks after they had already paid the dividends for this year. <!-- TODO -->
